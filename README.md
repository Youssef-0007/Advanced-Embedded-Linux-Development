# Socket Application and Character Device Driver

## Overview
This project encompasses the development of a multi-threaded socket application in C programming language and a character device driver for communication between user-space applications via socket. The project was built as part of the Advanced Embedded Linux Specialization from Coursera, provided by the University of Colorado at Boulder.

## Key Components
- **Multi-threaded Socket Application**: Designed and implemented a socket application capable of handling incoming connections, with each connection managed by its own thread.
- **Character Device Driver**: Developed a character device driver utilizing a circular buffer to facilitate communication between user-space applications via socket.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Testing Environments**: Buildroot and Yocto on QEMU

## Testing and Implementation
- Verified the functionality of the socket application and the character device driver on QEMU using Buildroot and Yocto environments.

## Course Information
This project was built as part of assignments from the Advanced Embedded Linux Specialization on Coursera, offered by the University of Colorado at Boulder.
